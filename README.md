Hi!

"response.pdf" contains my graphs for the hourly load data in Singapore and New Zealand;

"SG.py" and "NZ.py" are the Python codes I used to download and pre-process the data in Singapore and New Zealand. For both countries, I processed the data firstly in Python and then in STATA.

"data.dta" and "data.csv" are the same (just different formats), which contain all the hourly data points of SG and NZ in Jan 2016- Jun 2020;

"graphs.do" is the STATA do-file I used to generate graphs in "response.pdf".

Best,
Junshi
